# 1. Project introduction

## General info

This project creates the machine learning model that helps us to predict whether the given text message is spam or not.

## Skills Required

   * Programming Language - Python 

   * Machine Learning

   * Natural language processing

   * Predictive modeling

   * etc.


## Technologies used

This project is created using [**python**](https://www.python.org/) and other libraries like :

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Sklearn/Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#)
* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
* etc.

The other libraries are enlisted in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

## Setup

 
To run this project , install [**python**](https://www.python.org/) locally and install the requirements using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) -

```terminal
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```

else you can use the [google colab notebook](Spam_Classifier.ipynb) for running the code online without installing any libraries , packages and dependencies.

## Dataset


The dataset used in this project is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

# 2.Project Description





# 3.Deployment

Hence , the model is created using machine learning . The model needs to be deployed for its practical use.

We create a Web-App using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/).

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.


The sample Deployment web page looks like ::
